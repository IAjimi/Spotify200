## pitchfork_reviews

This Vignette briefly shows some of the information one can derive from the `pitchfork_reviews` dataset. It is important to remember that this dataset does not include data for all Pitchfork reviews, but only the subsegment relating to artists which were listed in `chart_positions`. These reviews are all of *albums*, so the number of observations in this dataset is necessarily smaller than that of `track_list`.

For instance, we can use this dataset to find the highest rated albums and albums.

```{r}
# More Appropriate Variable Types
pitchfork_reviews$score <- as.numeric(pitchfork_reviews$score)
pitchfork_reviews$pub_date <- as.Date(pitchfork_reviews$pub_date)

## Highest Rated Albums
pitchfork_reviews %>% arrange(desc(score)) %>% head(10) #highest scoring albums

## Highest Rated Artists
pitchfork_reviews %>% 
  group_by(artist) %>%
  summarize(score = mean(as.numeric(score), na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n()) %>%
  filter(!is.na(score)) %>%
  arrange(desc(score))

```

This analysis can easily be extended to 2019:

```{r}
## Highest Rated Albums -- 2019
pitchfork_reviews %>% filter(pub_date >= "2019-01-01") %>% arrange(desc(score)) %>% head(10) #highest scoring albums

## Highest Rated Artists
pitchfork_reviews %>% 
  filter(pub_date >= "2019-01-01") %>%
  group_by(artist) %>%
  summarize(score = mean(as.numeric(score), na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n()) %>%
  filter(!is.na(score)) %>%
  arrange(desc(score))

```

This dataset could also be combined at an album-level with `track_information` to add a measurement of (subjective) track quality.
